Discord Bot that reads questions from http://www.quizdb.org/

A Discord bot that uses Selenium python package to scrape text from the quiz bowl question database quizdb. The bot will send the text 4 words at a time, editing the message as it sends more words. Once a player sends the message 'Buzz', 'buzz', 'B', or 'b', the bot will stop reading the question and prompt the player for an answer. That player then has 10 seconds to answer the question, and after they answer, the bot will continue reading. The answer to the question is sent as a spoilered message, so players can check for themselves to see if they got the answer correct. The bot also has options to select specific categories and difficulties of questions. If no one answers for a few seconds after the entire question has been read, the bot will automatically move on to the next question. After reading 25 questions, the bot will  stop reading and state the percentage of questions that were answered correctly.
